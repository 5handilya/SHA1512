       <p>This was me after reading your views on learning and education. This is why I have tried to do more than what was asked in the listing. I would really like to work with you as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern (ideal) or a Software Engineering Intern</p>
       <h3>About me</h3>
       <p>Long story short: interested in computers and programming since childhood -> taught myself how to code -> adopted by local IT institute -> published an Android app in school -> toxic high-performance attitude adopted with PCM+CS for the JEE grind -> over-enrolled into several coaching classes for the same subject, little time for self-study -> burnout -> quit PCM + CS, switched to Commerce + Math thinking I'll get back to coding after "a while" -> after a few years spent as a shell of my former self, I have decided that that time is now</p>
       <p>(end of page: long story long / answer to this question from a different form of yours: "when & how did you realize that you love doing what you do")</p>
