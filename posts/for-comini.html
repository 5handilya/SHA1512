       <p>This was me after reading your views on learning and education. This is why I have tried to do more than what was asked in the listing. I would really like to work with you as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern (ideal) or as a Software Engineering Intern</p>
       <h3>About me</h3>
    <p><strong>Long story short:</strong></p>
    <p>-> interested in computers and programming since childhood</p>
    <p>-> taught myself how to code</p>
    <p>-> adopted by local IT institute</p>
    <p>-> published an Android app in school</p>
    <p>-> toxic high-performance attitude adopted with PCM+CS for the JEE grind</p>
    <p>-> over-enrolled into several coaching classes for the same subject, little time for self-study</p>
    <p>-> burnout</p>
    <p>-> quit PCM + CS, switched to Commerce + Math thinking I'll get back to coding after "a while"</p>
    <p>-> after a few years spent as a shell of my former self, I have decided that that time is now</p>
       <p>(end of page: long story long / answer to this question from a different form of yours: "when & how did you realize that you love doing what you do")</p>

    <h3>Long story long</h3>
    <p><strong>or, "When and how did you realize that you like doing what you do?"</strong></p>
    <p>I love programming.</p>

    <p>My life changed when I received a hand-me-down 800 Mhz Celeron box from a relative when I was about 7 years old. I must have disassembled and re-assembled that computer a thousand times just to marvel at the hardware inside. I have, to this day, not had an experience more enchanting.</p>

    <p>I learned QBASIC, got a better computer, started using linux (Ubuntu 9.04), learned C++ and Java from books in my school library by 2010. I made my first game (a platformer on unity) and my first android app (for study schedule management, called "Buddy") when I was in class 6. I was a good student and knew what diligence and focus looked like. But, with programming, I got to know flow state for the first time.</p>

    <p>An IT institution / repair shop near my house was happy with my interest in computers. The man who ran the store/institution (lost to covid, RIP) asked me to come there every weekend and on any weekday I wanted and sit in on any lecture I wanted or be an apprentice under any technician I wanted. I spent some of the best days of my childhood in that building - poring over books on OS fundamentals, networking, etc. and learning how to solder thanks to a man I only got to know by his nickname "TK," who helped me replace aging capacitors on my old computer's motherboard. I enjoyed almost every lecture I attended, and was increasingly aware of my interest in computers in general.</p>

    <p>I published my first android app in class 11. Receiving feedback from people and pushing out updates ASAP looked like hard work to my family members watching me as I was on my computer from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed, but to me it was one of the most fun periods of my life. (not just in hindsight, even when I experienced it)</p>

    <p>After sacrificing most of my toys and several household appliances to the noble cause of "lets open it and see whats inside"-utility, I know now that I love machines in general. We arrange materials around us in such intricate ways that make them extraordinarily useful - much more than the sum of their parts - and I think this is magical. Programming, then, is beyond magic! By chanting the right words, we can manifest almost any flowchart we can imagine and give it the form of a digital machine (which is cool enough on its own, given it doesn't even need to move atoms, generally, just electrons)</p>

    <p>There was once a water supply issue at our home (we had to manually turn on the water pump to fill our water tank every day at a specific time, and the durations can be very tight sometimes). I used a moisture detector, a relay, an ESP32, and an SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor to automate this turning on and off of the water pump. When I sat admiring it work for the first time, I saw my flowchart solve a solid real-world problem right in front of me. I thought of dams, nuclear power plants, and airplanes - all driven by these magical flowcharts. At that point I knew for sure that digital machines and their programming are cosmologically significant, and that I love working with them.</p>
