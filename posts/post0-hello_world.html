            <p>i was about to stop exploring web dev, irritated by the sloppy mess that is the *script ecosystem, when i discovered HTMX. i love it, and this whole blog will be made using only HTMX, HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>my life changed when i got my first computer. it was a hand-me-down Celeron 800Mhz tower with 128MB of SIMM RAM and a nice CRT on which i looked forward to viewing the next Windows XP wallpaper every day. i wrote my first piece of code (QBASIC) on it. the beauty of the relationship between a programmer and a computer was impressed upon me with delightful permanence. i found a book on C++ and Java from my school library and went through all of it, and my first real projects were little CLI utilities in C++ and android apps in Java.</p>
            <p>i still love playing with computers. this place is meant to be a playtime log. i will be posting about my excursions into data science, machine learning engineering and research, CS theory, etc. </p>
            <p>until then, good bye</p>
