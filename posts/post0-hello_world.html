      <p>i was about to stop exploring web dev, irritated by the sloppy mess that is the *script ecosystem, when i discovered HTMX. i love it, and this whole blog will be made using only HTMX, HTML and CSS. i will be posting about data science, machine learning engineering and research, CS theory, etc. until then, good bye!</p>
