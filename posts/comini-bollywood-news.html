    <p>The challenge: Create a Chrome extension that would transform mundane news articles into vibrant pieces of Bollywood culture. The extension needs to do two things:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Transform any news article into a Bollywood-style song that captures the essence of the news</li>
        <li>Convert the article's title into a fitting Bollywood movie name</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>

    <p>I decided to tackle this using a finetuned (not by me) version of Gemma2b: the Gemma-2-9b-it-SimPO using Ollama. Why this model? Because I have used this particular model for such tasks (write A in B style), and it handles English + Hinglish + Devanagri well enough. In general, it offers a good balance between speed and quality.</p>

    <h2>Why I didn't finetune</h2>

    <p>I have an implementation-level understanding of finetuning using LoRA, and did a finetune of llama3:3b for the other ML challenge (icons using an LLM). I found my compute resources severely lacking to test it well enough for me to include it in my application. My strategy would have been to experiment with <a href="https://github.com/hbdeshmukh/bollywood-lyrics?tab=readme-ov-file">this</a> dataset or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranirathore/bollywood-hindi-songs">this</a> one to get theme:song mappings, and then use a chain of 2 LLMs: one to parse the tone and facts of the article, another feed it to the tone:lyrics finetuned model for final output.</p>

    <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mixed Content Issues:</strong> Chrome's security policies around HTTP/HTTPS content required some unsafe solutions for communicating with the local Ollama server (HTTP).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>CORS Headers:</strong> The Ollama server needed configuration adjustments (EXPORT OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*) to handle cross-origin requests properly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Fun Part: Prompt Engineering</h2>

    <p>Having previously experimented with transmuting artistic styles, designing the prompts was the most enjoyable part for me. The extension uses two distinct prompts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Title prompt:</strong>"in maximum 10 words return a bollwood movie style title in hindi relevant to the following news title (no comments, title only):"</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Content prompt:</strong> "based on the content, theme, and tone of the following news article, turn it into a related fictional bollywood song. try to include key points in the article (no comments, lyrics only): "</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>

    <p>Once I have access to better computing resources, I can implement and test the fine-tuned model version. This would potentially improve the quality and consistency of the generated content while making the transformations more authentic even for longer article lengths, and weave in more of the key points mentioned in the article.</p>
