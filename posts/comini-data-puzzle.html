           I don't believe I was able to find what was hidden in the data. Here is a clean version of notes taken while exploring the challenge.

           <h2>The Data</h1>  
        <ul>
            <li>finding it was a simple matter of following the code</li>
            <li>10000 rows, 7 columns</li>
            <li>7th column is either 0 (for 9766) or 1 (for 234).</li>
            <li>First 6 columns have each 0.01 interval from 0.00 to 0.99 exactly 100 times, thus each has a total of 4950</li>
            <li>No single (1-6) column has an unusually strong correlation with the 7th column</li>
            <li>This seems procedurally generated</li>
            <li>The sums of the first 6 or 7 columns taken together don't show a unique distribution</li>

        </ul>
        Initial thoughts:
        <ul>
            <li>'1' appears a small no. of times, and the indices don't seem to follow a pattern in terms of gap between indices and gaps between gaps -> 1 is used for encoding?</li>
            <br>
            <li>10000 could represent 100x100 grid for a 2d map, so i used a normalized sum of the first 6 columns for greyscale and rgb visualizations:</li>

            <br>
            <br>
            <li>i tried using column 7 as a binary mask</li>
            <br>
            <img src="/posts/images/misc-comini/data-masked.png" width="100%">
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>i tried visualizing the 6 columns as 2 sets of 3D coordinates and 3 sets of 2D coordinates</li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <li>surely not a barcode? (no)</li>
            <br>
            <img src="/posts/images/misc-comini/data-barcode.png" width="100%">
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>lastly, here's the first 6 columns represented as vectors in 2D space, with c1,c2 = origin, c3,c4 used to encode rotation, c5,c6 encoding magnitude. somewhat interesting founta-like pattern seen, though that could simply be the result of procedural generation and not be meaningful</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            This challenge was the one I found most fun and spent the most time on. There were many other approaches that I tried but forgot to document, but, sadly, I don't think I found the solution. On the plus side, I had good fun playing with it.
