            <h2>The Challenge</h2> 
            <p>"Understand what it (the Recenter browser plugin) is for and suggest an interesting and useful feature you can add to it."</p>
            <p>
            I use the Forest app to log how much time I'm spending where. On my phone, I am watchful of my screentime category-wise splits: the reality checks they sometimes give are helpful. My friends and I also keep track of "daily hours focused" in a shared spreadsheet. </p>
            <p>This was my context when I used Recenter for the first time. I don't really see myself using this extension, because I have a strong dislike for excessive logging - and I think what I do is already too much. I think too much logging slows me down, although some is crucial. It's like salt.</p>
            <p>But if I did use an open source extension like Recenter, I would hack it to use my local LLM for summaries and website tagging. I understand this is not a good idea product-wise, it is just what I would do as the user. This way, I would keep keep my browsing history private and also have more control over the tone and style of feedback through the summary features.</p>
            <p>Thus, I chose local LLM summaries as the feature added for this hiring challenge.</p>
            <h3>The Feature</h3>

            <p>
            I implemented some UI changes in AuthKeyBox.tsx to include Input fields for custom API URLs. I also added non-ChatGPT options for the proprietary summary option (API call code as well, though not tested because I don't have any keys)</p>

            <p>Above: HTTP request generated (had to modify API_Call.ts, et al) </p>

            <p>Above: Summary generated (you can see hints of your other hiring challenges haha)</p>
            <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Once I have finished ironing out some bugs in the AI tagging feature, I can see myself using this browser with my local LLM baked in. Running very small models finetuned for summary-generation using WASM could be an interesting future direction for this.</p>
