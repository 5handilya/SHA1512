        <em>
        <p>A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:</p>
        <p>Its loveliness increases; it will never</p>
        <p>Pass into nothingness; but still will keep</p>
        <p>A bower quiet for us, and a sleep</p>
        <p>Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.</p>
        <p>Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing</p>
        <p>A flowery band to bind us to the earth,</p>
        <p>Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth</p>
        <p>Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,</p>
        <p>Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways</p>
        <p>Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,</p>
        <p>Some shape of beauty moves away the pall</p>
        <p>From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,</p>
        <p>Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon</p>
        <p>For simple sheep; and such are daffodils</p>
        <p>With the green world they live in; and clear rills</p>
        <p>That for themselves a cooling covert make</p>
        <p>'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,</p>
        <p>Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:</p>
        <p>And such too is the grandeur of the dooms</p>
        <p>We have imagined for the mighty dead;</p>
        <p>All lovely tales that we have heard or read:</p>
        <p>An endless fountain of immortal drink,</p>
        <p>Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><b>Invictus <em>by William Henley</em></b></p>
        <em>
        <p>Out of the night that covers me,</p>
        <p>Black as the pit from pole to pole,</p>
        <p>I thank whatever gods may be</p>
        <p>For my unconquerable soul.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the fell clutch of circumstance</p>
        <p>I have not winced nor cried aloud.</p>
        <p>Under the bludgeonings of chance</p>
        <p>My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears</p>
        <p>Looms but the Horror of the shade,</p>
        <p>And yet the menace of the years</p>
        <p>Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It matters not how strait the gate,</p>
        <p>How charged with punishments the scroll,</p>
        <p>I am the master of my fate,</p>
        <p>I am the captain of my soul.</p>
